# Handling Json Parse and Json Stringify in Javascript

In this today's article,
i will share with you how we can handle json parse and stringify in javascript.

- Let get started.

## what is JSON?
JSON(Javascript Object Notation) - JSON is a text-based format mostly(.json files) used for storing and transferring data.JSON is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format that is used to store and exchange data between different systems. It is one of the most popular data formats used in web applications and APIs.

            //JSON syntax
                {
                    "id" : "Emma",
                    "Occupation" : "Software Engineer",
                    "Salary" : "40,000"
                    "Currency" :"USD"
                }

### Why use JSON?
In web application, storing of data is occasionally done using the json format which stores data in a readable format.
It is easy to read and write, making it a great choice for data interchange between applications running on different platforms. JSON is also supported by most modern programming languages and is commonly used to send data over the web. JSON is often used as an alternative to XML (Extensible Markup Language)  due to its smaller size and faster parsing.

> - Note: JSON are always enclosed with arrays or objects(literals) when storing data.

        JSON Array - are enclosed in an array [].

        // let list an array of laptops and prices.
        ["MacBook", "price" "$20,000", "Dell","price" "$40,000",]



        
        JSON Objects - are enclosed in a curly brackets {}.

        // let list an objects of laptops and prices.
        {"name" : "MacBook", "price" "$20,000", "Dell", "price" "$20,000"}
